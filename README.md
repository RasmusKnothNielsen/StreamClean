# StreamClean

Repository for the IOS app StreamClean

This project is a sideproject intended to practice IOS development.
Furthermore it is intended to inform users about how much CO2 they use when they stream.

Consider it a work in process, since large chuncks of potential functionality is still missing, not to talk about the design is still not done.

These are functionality that I want to implement over time:

- Add User signup / Sign in with apple, email, facebook and so on

- Add Firebase Functionality for storing previous user inputs to enable comparison over time

- Making graphics for the result page

- General design of pages and overall design

- Icon design
