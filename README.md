# StreamClean

Repository for the IOS app StreamClean

This project is a sideproject intended to practice IOS development.
Furthermore it is intended to make people more aware of how much CO2 emission is related to daily streaming.
Through this awareness, I hope to inspire customers to demand cleaner streamingservices, CO2 emission-wise.

Consider it a work in process, since large chuncks of potential functionality is still missing, not to talk about the design is still not done.

These are some of the functionality that I want to implement over time:

- Add User signup / Sign in with apple, email, facebook and so on

- Add Firebase Functionality for storing previous user inputs to enable comparison over time

- Making graphics for the result page

- General design of pages and overall design

- Icon design

For more information and many other things to be implemented, take a look at the TODO.md file.
