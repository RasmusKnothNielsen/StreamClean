#TODO list

- Make new page to display other streaming choices, such as
  - Music streaming
  - General internet usage (Facebook etc.)

- Find a way to make it easy for the user to input the number of hours and minutes. 
  Is it necessary to get the user to pick single minutes, like 1 hour and 12 minutes? Maybe allow either 15 min/ 30 min  intervals.


- Find out if it is possible to get the data directly from Screen Time
