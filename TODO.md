#TODO list

- Make new page to display other streaming choices, such as
  - Music streaming ✓
  - General internet usage (Facebook etc.) ✓
  - Video conferencing ✓

- Find a way to make it easy for the user to input the number of hours and minutes. 
  Is it necessary to get the user to pick single minutes, like 1 hour and 12 minutes? Maybe allow either 15 min/ 30 min  intervals.
  
 - Consider if the user wants to choose the quality of the stream, since 4k streaming is vastly different from 720p

    - Apple 
    - Firebase ✓
    - Facebook ✓

- If saving the usage to the database, get the current week number and save it with the rest of the information

- Add Firebase Functionality for storing previous user inputs

- Tell the user that the sign up was successful ✓

- Implement the logic to calculate the milage used when streaming ✓

- On result page, add a comparison between the users usage and the average usage of a person, shown in percentage. Example:

    - You used 50% less than the average person this week

- If user is logged in, and have previous inputs, compare the current usage with the last one, and show the difference. Did the user use more or less? Example:
    - Your streaming usage is 5% higher this week than the last input in week X
