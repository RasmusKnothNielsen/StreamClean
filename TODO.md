#TODO list

- Make new page to display other streaming choices, such as
  - Music streaming ✓
  - General internet usage (Facebook etc.) ✓

- Find a way to make it easy for the user to input the number of hours and minutes. 
  Is it necessary to get the user to pick single minutes, like 1 hour and 12 minutes? Maybe allow either 15 min/ 30 min  intervals.
  
 - Consider if the user wants to choose the quality of the stream, since 4k streaming is vastly different from 720p

- Add User signup / Sign in with apple, email, facebook and so on

- Add Firebase Functionality for storing previous user inputs

- Find out if it is possible to get the data directly from Screen Time (It is not!)

- Implement the logic to calculate the milage used when streaming ✓

- Finding or making visuals for the result page

- General design of pages and overall design

- Icon design

- Add bell sounds and audio of a woman chanting "shame"
